# Java-Projects
Java codes from EECS285, mostly focused on object oriented java programming.
Proj1 and Proj2 on object oriented programing
Proj3 on game wheel of fortune. (using some graphic in java)
Proj4 is a game designed by me and 2 other developers, its a remake of classic game Plants vs Zombie.
      We remake it to Food vs. Zombie. Overall its a very fun game, just a little unbalance
